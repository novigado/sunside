# Nucleus Project Library Feature

## Executive Summary

Transform the City Shadow Analyzer into a **collaborative urban planning tool** by integrating NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus for persistent storage, shared city models, and team collaboration.

## The Problem

### Current Limitations:
1. **Redundant Data Fetching**: Every user must fetch building data from OpenStreetMap APIs, causing:
   - Slow initial load times (10-30 seconds per city area)
   - Rate limit issues with repeated queries
   - Network dependency for every session

2. **No Persistence**: Analysis results disappear when app closes:
   - Cannot review previous analyses
   - Cannot compare multiple scenarios
   - Lost institutional knowledge

3. **No Collaboration**: Isolated work environment:
   - Teams can't share city models
   - No way to review colleague's shadow studies
   - Duplicate effort across organization

4. **No Version Control**: Cannot track design iterations:
   - "What did the shadow look like last week?"
   - "Which design alternative cast less shadow?"
   - No audit trail for regulatory compliance

## The Solution: Nucleus-Backed Project Library

### Core Features:

#### 1. **Shared City Model Cache**
Store OpenStreetMap building geometry on Nucleus server:
- **Path Structure**: `omniverse://nucleus-server/CityLibrary/{region}/{city}/buildings.usd`
- **Metadata**: Bounds, building count, terrain data, last updated
- **Smart Loading**: Check Nucleus before fetching from OSM
- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ 10x faster loading (local read vs API call)
  - ✅ Works offline (once cached)
  - ✅ No API rate limits
  - ✅ Shared across team

#### 2. **Project-Based Analysis Storage**
Organize work into projects with persistent results:
- **Path Structure**: `omniverse://nucleus-server/Projects/{project_name}/`
  - `city_model.usd` - The base city geometry
  - `scenarios/current.usd` - Current state analysis
  - `scenarios/proposed_tower.usd` - With new building
  - `scenarios/alternative_design.usd` - Different design
  - `results/shadow_analysis_2026-01-14.usd` - Timestamped results
- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ Compare multiple design scenarios
  - ✅ Review analysis history
  - ✅ Share with stakeholders via Nucleus URL

#### 3. **Collaborative Workflows**
Enable team collaboration on urban planning:
- **Live Updates**: See when colleagues update analyses
- **Comments**: Annotate USD with notes and concerns
- **Version History**: Track who changed what and when
- **Access Control**: Read-only for reviewers, edit for planners
- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ Real-time collaboration
  - ✅ Institutional knowledge preservation
  - ✅ Regulatory compliance (audit trail)

#### 4. **Project Browser UI**
New UI panel for managing Nucleus projects:
- Browse existing projects on Nucleus
- Create new projects with metadata
- Load city models from library
- Compare scenario results side-by-side
- Export reports/visualizations

2. **Mobile App**: Field shadow queries from mobile devices
3. **AI Integration**: ML-based shadow optimization suggestions
4. **GIS Integration**: QGIS/ArcGIS connector plugins
5. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users editing simultaneously
6. **Cloud Rendering**: Omniverse Farm for batch analysis
7. **Analytics Dashboard**: Usage metrics and insights

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks:
- **Nucleus availability**: Mitigation: Fallback to local storage
- **Network latency**: Mitigation: Aggressive local caching
- **USD versioning**: Mitigation: Schema versioning system

### User Adoption Risks:
- **Learning curve**: Mitigation: Tutorial videos and docs
- **Migration effort**: Mitigation: Import existing work
- **Server setup**: Mitigation: Simplified setup guide

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators:
1. **Load Time**: Average city load time < 5 seconds (cached)
2. **Cache Hit Rate**: > 70% of loads use cache
3. **User Adoption**: > 50% of users create projects
4. **Collaboration**: > 30% of projects shared with team
5. **Storage Usage**: Average project size < 500 MB

### Measurement Plan:
- Add telemetry for cache hits/misses
- Track project creation frequency
- Monitor Nucleus storage usage
- User surveys for satisfaction
